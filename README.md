## Create File Structure

- Amongst yourselves, Choose someone to do this locally and then push it to the main branch using GIT or GIT DESKTOP.

First of all letâ€™s set up the basic structure on the main branch:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

**Note that this is the only time we will be touching this branch for now, afterwards you will be creating a develop branch and this will be your working/changing branch.**

## Creating Branches

Choose someone (maybe the same person as before or someone else) to add a new branch locally called  develop.

Then publish this branch to the remote. You can do this in github desktop.

Now everyone else should be able to do git pull or git fetch and see the new branch locally.
